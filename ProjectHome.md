Why Hermes? Hermes, or Mercury as the Romans later knew him, was the Greek god of commerce, language and measurement, and the protector of merchants and travelers. He is associated with alchemy, including the ability to turn lead into gold. Light-footed and lighthearted, Hermes was also ingenious, a clever inventor and a shrewd negotiator.

As the swift messenger of the gods, Hermes is famed for crossing boundaries and enabling communication and cross-cultural understanding. Itâ€™s no surprise then that Hermes is the perfect emblem for this project. Skilled, agile and entrepreneurial, Hermes is the spirit of blogospher and the sign of the times.

The Hermes Reader will be a web based application that will allow the administrator to configure a set of RSS/ATOM feeds as the source of information to be displayed on the site.  Much like other feed aggregators, with a twist, the post will be displayed in publication order for all feed sources, the tag/categories will filter across all source feeds, and selecting a date will display items from all feeds for that date.  It will also offer the ability to filter by a specific feed, the more traditional aggregator view.
